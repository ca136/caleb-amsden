    Growing up on a small farm taught me two important lessons: knowing 
    how to work hard and work smart. Now, I apply those lessons as a 
    web developer, designer and entrepreneur.
</p>
<h3>Technical Background</h3>
<p>
    I first start programming when my boss gave me an old CentOS server 
    and told me to build an API. I bought a book on Perl and then learned a 
    lot about Linux, databases and scripting. Six months after we 
    launched, we had already earned $1 million in revenue and were 
    profitable.
</p>
<p>
    I worked relentlessly to build a successful product, and learned 
    how to adjust to challenges and changing environments. Some of 
    the challenges my team overcame include:
</p>
<p><ul>
    <li>Scaling an API to deal with 1,000s of requests/second.</li>
    <li>Creating an optimized database with over a 100 million records.</li>
    <li>Building a system to sanitize new and existing records in real-time.</li>
    <li>Creating an analytics platform to analyze data patterns.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Full-stack developer, UX designer</h3>
<p>
    All my side projects have focused on building web apps that make 
    people's lives easier (I have a soft spot for SMBs). This required 
    becoming an expert on how to build interfaces that get out of the way 
    and empower the user. 
</p>
<p>
    For my first full-stack web application I built a really useful app that 
    helped sellers on Etsy easily create and send newsletters. The user 
    experience wasn't very good and 90% of my users only used the app once. 
    I learned from the mistake and built a new, clean UI that converts 50% of 
    users that try the product.
</p>
<h3>Most recently, Tech lead at a rising NYC-based startup</h3>
<p>
    Most recently I worked as Lead Developer at I Like What You're Wearing. 
    Forbes called us "Facebook + Vogue + Amazon". As the first technical 
    hire at ILWYW, I was responsible for crafting an experience that showcased 
    the hottest new fashion designers.
</p>
<p>
    I refactored the MVP, added DB caching and a CDN, and was able to 
    reduce page load times to under 1 second for every page on the site. I am 
    also proud to have:
</p>
<p><ul>
    <li>
        Designed and produced the entire front-end e-commerce platform. Our 
        users loved spending time on the site (over 6 min. average), and our 
        designers were super passionate about how we added to their brand value.
    </li>
    <li>
        Built a very fast, easy-to-use and most of all reliable site: our only 
        down-time occurred when we forgot to renew our domain... Doh!
    </li>
    <li>
        Created a great experience on mobile. By building a responsive site 
        layout and optimizing for tablets, our tablet users purchased 20% more 
        often than regular site users.
    </li>
</ul></p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
    Overall, I'm really passionate about creating great products and unique 
    experiences for users. If you're interested in getting in touch, you can
